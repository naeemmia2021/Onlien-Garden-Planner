      "cultdesc":"Wood apple can be grown in dry tracts of tropical and sub-tropical regions right from sealevel upto 1400m above  MSL.It is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions including degraded soil.It can also tolerate salinity to certain extent. It is an ideal tree to be exploited for growing in wasteland.Normally wood apple is not planted in fertile or rich soils.In wasteland if mass planting is to be done.then pit lines are drawn across the slope and pits can be dug at a spacing of 8Mx8M each pit with a size of 1 Mx1Mx1M.Planting should be done at the onset of monsoon after filling the pit with 20 kg FYM sand and top soil. The basins should be formed immediately after planting in such a way that water harvesting is facilitated."
