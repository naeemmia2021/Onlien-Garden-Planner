      "author":" The jackfruit thrives in the tropical low lands below an elevation of 1000m. A warm, wet climate is best. It flourishes in humid hill slopes even up to an elevation of 1500m but the quality of fruits deteriorates in higher altitudes. The tree will grow on almost any soil, but prefers a deep, well-drained loam soil. Drainage must be good, on the other hand, the soil moisture content must be kept at a high level."
