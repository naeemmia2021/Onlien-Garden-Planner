      "bookname":"A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.

      "author":"Almost any kind of soil is good for mango except such soils which are less than one metre in depth and those with sub-soils having rocks or too sticky as clay.Some of the best mango orchards of Bangladesh are found in the gangetic flood plains in soils rich in alluvium loam deepand with a substratum of loose gravel. The optimum pH of soil for good growth ranges from 5.5 to 7.5.Mango flourishes well under conditions where there is enough rain to weight the soil up to a good depthand a well-defined dry season with no rain at all. The setting of fruits is adversely affected by fog rainor cloudy weather in January-March when the trees flower. Mild showers at the time of development and enlargement of fruits are beneficialbut storms particularly hailstorms adversely affect them often resulting in immature fruit drops."
